3. Bot greets the user based on language
4. User clicks "Download Video 🎥"
5. Bot asks for video link
6. User sends link
7. Bot asks for quality (HD / SD / Audio)
8. Bot downloads, re-encodes safely, checks file size
9. Bot sends the file
10. Bot deletes the local copy to stay clean

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IbrahimVidSave.git
   cd IbrahimVidSave
   ```

2. Create virtual environment

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token-here
   ```

5. Run the bot

   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

✅ Bot will start polling and you can interact with it directly.

## 🧠 Key Challenges and How I Solved Them

| Challenge                                  | Solution                                               |
| :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Videos frozen after download               | Forced safe re-encoding using ffmpeg (H.264 + AAC)     |
| Telegram bot freezing after quality choice | Properly handled callback_query vs message types       |
| Secure token management                    | Used `.env` and `python-dotenv`                        |
| File too large to send                     | Checked file size before sending                       |
| Friendly multilingual UX                   | Centralized text in `texts.py` and adapted dynamically |

## 📚 What I Learned

- Using yt-dlp and ffmpeg programmatically
- Managing Telegram Bot conversations with multiple states
- Debugging real async bot behavior
- Structuring scalable multilingual bots
- Properly handling API secrets and bot security
- UX design for bots (Menus, cancel options, easy navigation)

---

## 🔥 Future Improvements

- Auto-detect user's preferred language based on Telegram profile
- Hosting the bot on a cloud server (AWS, Railway, etc.)
- Support more platforms like Facebook, X (Twitter)
- Add progress bar for large downloads
